        <p>
            About 3.5 million years ago, the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy unleashed an
            enormous burst of energy. Our primitive ancestors, already afoot on the African plains, likely would have
            witnessed this flare as a ghostly glow high overhead in the constellation Sagittarius. It might have
            persisted for 1 million years.
